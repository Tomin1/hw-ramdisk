This init ramdisk is created in order to boot Mer.

This ramdisk can be used by either flashing or loading the kernel and ramdisk
to the device memory with following command:

Load:
$Â fastboot boot <kernel_zImage> hw-ramdisk.gz

Flash (NOTE: Be sure you have backups of your kernel and ramdiskd before doing this):
$ fastboot flash:raw boot <kernel_zImage> hw-ramdisk.gz

Combine with kernel:
$ mkbootimg --kernel arch/arm/boot/zImage --ramdisk /boot/hw-ramdisk.gz --cmdline "<your kernel command line>" --base 0x80200000 --offset 0x02000000 --pagesize 2048 -o boot.img


You can change what is mounted as root by the initrd by editing the init script
and changing $MNTSCRIPT to point to your own device specific root mount script.

The hw-ramdisk.gz is installed into /boot/hw-ramdisk.gz and you can use it
as base in kernel packaging. Just add a "BuildRequires: hw-ramdisk" to
make it available and then add to it to make the final combined kernel +
initrd image (or if needed, final separate initrd).
